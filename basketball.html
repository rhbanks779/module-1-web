    <p id='basketballInfo'>Practices are held at Batavia Elementary, Batavia Middle school and other local places.  Home games for K-3rd grade are held at the elementary school.  Home games for 4th grade and above are held at the middle school.  K/1 do not play away games, the rest play local teams in the CPYBL or SWOL.

        <br><br>All players must have the standard uniform.The official practice schedule is not made until after teams are formed. You could practice anywhere from 4:45PM (start time) - 8:30PM (end time). Your childs team will practice one or two times a week depending on the coaches availability and team preference. <br><br>Most of our teams practice once during the week and once on Sunday.

        Our teams practice at one of several locations: Batavia Middle School, Batavia Elementary School, Wildey School in Owensville, or the SODC up near UC Clermont.
       <br><br>Practices start ramping up in November and the schedule ends by March. For each team your child is on they will be scheduled for 11 games. Weather sometimes cancels games, but you will be scheduled for 11.
        You are signing up to commit to a team. It is expected that your player be at the vast majority of practices and games. <br><br>This is usually not a problem, however when it is there is a process that we go through, the process stops when the problem is resolved.

    Coach talks to parent about the issue.
    Coach escalates the issue to the Basketball Rep. The Rep gives a plan of action if there is a good solution to it.
    <br><br>Coach sends an email to the parent, cc'ing the Basketball Rep letting the parent know that if the player misses another practice, they will not play in the following games and that future missed practices may require a doctors note.
    Basketball Rep talks to the parent about their future on the team and works to find a solution.


I can assure you that 99% of issues are resolved after the email is sent to parents and the basketball rep.
